# Sarah's Website!
https://sxrah404.github.io/

This is the first website I've built from scratch. It's definitely not perfect but I'm proud of it! I was bored the week before the semester began, so I decided to challenge myself to learn more about web development and design before I got too busy with school. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build it and I enjoyed the whole learning process (except the part where I had to make it responsive... I never want to do that again). I intend on making more changes in the future! But for now I would like to step away from the computer and touch grass.
